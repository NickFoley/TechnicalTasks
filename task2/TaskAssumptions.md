#Question
- The Task does not stipulate what should happen before 4 readings are available.
- Should the average have a minimum of 1 point or should no value be displayed

#Assumption
- In the absence of 4 data points the minimum average is derived from 1 to 3 points, ensuring the graph looks
  consistent.
