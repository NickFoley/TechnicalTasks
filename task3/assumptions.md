#Question
- The task stipulates to group into 5 minute averages?
- Does this mean to average all values or just one value?
- The data contains readings from multiple different sources (Ace, DSCOVR).
- Are these different sources to be combined for the purpose of creating an average?

#Assumptions
- All data, that can be, is averaged into 5 minute blocks.
- All readings from different sources are combined.
