#Question
- The task says "multiples of both four and seven print "Mission Control"." Is this a typo and should it be "4 and 5"?
- The Task does not stipulate what should happen when a number is divisible by both 4 and 5. 
- Should "Mission", "Control" or "MissionControl" be printed?

#Assumption
- That 4 should take preference over 5 and only print "Mission"
